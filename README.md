Run ``./icqenze file`` if you want to compile and execute the compiled file, and then change ``file`` using any text editor , then by just saving the changes in the file, it will recompile automatically.
Use ``./cqenze file output``to 'compile' to a CHmUsiCK's file.

If you want to use your own samples, simply copy the folders
in dirt folder.

Folder's name must not contain numbers or spaces, samples must not
be in subfolders and every sample must be named with numbers.

Only ``.wav`` for now.
